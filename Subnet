A Subnet is a logically visible subdivision of an IP network. 
Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable parts to improve performance, organization, and security.


## Key Concepts
1) IP Address: Every device on a network has an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.10), which includes:

Network portion: Identifies the network.
Host portion: Identifies the device within the network.

2) Subnet Mask: Defines which part of the IP address is the network and which part is the host. For example:

IP address: 192.168.1.10

Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

Network part: 192.168.1

Host part: .10

3) CIDR Notation: A compact way to represent a subnet using a slash (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24). 
The /24 indicates that the first 24 bits are the network portion.
