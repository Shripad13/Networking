## An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number used to identify a device on a network.

## Breakdown of IPv4 Bits
Total bits: 32

Divided into 4 octets (8 bits each), usually written in dotted decimal format.

Example: 192.168.1.1

Binary equivalent: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001

Each octet (segment) can range from 0 to 255, because:

2^8 = 256

Valid range: 
0 to 255

## Structure
An IPv4 address typically includes:

Network portion: Defines which network the IP belongs to.

Host portion: Identifies the specific device (host) on that network.

The division between network and host parts depends on the subnet mask.

## Example with Subnet Mask
IP: 192.168.1.10

Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 → 24 bits for network, 8 bits for host

Network portion: 192.168.1

Host portion: .10
